### Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of employee attrition data for a company, focusing on identifying key metrics related to employee turnover. By analyzing trends in employee demographics, job roles, and satisfaction levels, we aim to provide insights for reducing attrition and improving employee satisfaction. The data was analyzed and visualized using Power BI to create a user-friendly and interactive dashboard.

---

### Objectives

The main objectives of this HR analysis project are as follows:

- Determine the overall attrition rate and identify which employee demographics or job roles are most affected by attrition.
- Analyze employee satisfaction across different job roles to understand dissatisfaction drivers.
- Identify trends in attrition based on age groups, education fields, and marital status.
- Provide actionable recommendations for reducing attrition and enhancing employee retention.

### Tools Used:

For this project, I leveraged the following tools:

1. **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
   
2. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Performed advanced calculations, including attrition rate, average age by department, and satisfaction scores.
   
3. **Excel**: Initial data cleaning and exploration.
  
4. **Power Query**: Used for data transformation and ensuring data consistency.

5. **Github**: Used for portfolio building.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

The dataset was clean and consistent, requiring minimal preprocessing. **Power BI’s column profiling tools** (*Column Quality, Column Distribution, and Column Profile*), was used to ensure that the dataset was free from missing or erroneous values. These tools verified that the data was 100% consistent.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis focused on answering strategic HR-related questions:

1. **What is the overall attrition rate, and which age groups, genders, or departments are most affected?**
2. **How does job satisfaction vary across different job roles?**
3. **Which educational backgrounds are most common among employees with high attrition rates?**
4. **How does marital status correlate with attrition?**

These questions guided the analysis to identify areas for targeted interventions.

### Data Analysis

The HR Data Analysis Tracker was developed using Power BI to provide insights into attrition, satisfaction, and employee demographics. The dashboard includes several interactive visuals, such as:

1. **Summary Metrics**: A high-level overview of attrition metrics, including:
   - Attrition Count: 237 employees
   - Total Number of Employees: 1,470
   - Number of Current Employees: 1,233
   - Attrition Rate: 16%
   - Average Attrition Age: 37 years

2. **Attrition by Education Field**: Bar chart showing attrition counts across different education fields, highlighting high attrition in fields like Life Sciences and Marketing.

3. **Attrition by Department**: A pie chart showing attrition counts by department, with R&D (56%) and Sales (31%) having the highest attrition rates.

4. **Attrition by Gender**: A pie chart displaying gender distribution among employees who left, showing that male employees have a slightly higher attrition rate (63%).

5. **Current Employee Count by Gender and Age Group**: A bar chart displaying the count of current employees by age group and gender, showing that most employees are between 25-34 years.

6. **Attrition by Age Group and Gender**: Individual donut charts for each age group, breaking down attrition by gender.

7. **Satisfaction Levels by Job Role**: A matrix displaying satisfaction scores by job role, showing higher dissatisfaction among Laboratory Technicians and Healthcare Representatives.

8. **Attrition Count by Age Band**: A histogram illustrating the distribution of attrition across age bands, with the highest attrition rate among employees aged 25-34.

### Key Findings

**What is Working:**
- **High Retention in Certain Departments**: Departments like HR and R&D show moderate satisfaction levels, indicating relatively stable retention in these areas.
- **Age and Gender Distribution**: Younger employees (25-34) have the highest representation, suggesting that the company successfully attracts early-career professionals.

**What Needs Improvement:**
- **High Attrition Rate**: The attrition rate of 16% is relatively high, with significant turnover in the R&D and Sales departments.
- **Satisfaction Levels**: Low satisfaction scores among Laboratory Technicians and Healthcare Representatives highlight a need for targeted engagement strategies.
- **Education Field Influence**: Employees from Life Sciences and Marketing have higher attrition rates, suggesting the need to review expectations and career growth opportunities for these fields.

### Recommendations

1. **Implement Retention Programs for High-Attrition Departments**: Focus on R&D and Sales with tailored retention strategies, such as professional development and clear career paths.
2. **Enhance Job Satisfaction Initiatives**: Address dissatisfaction among Laboratory Technicians and Healthcare Representatives by assessing workload, compensation, and work-life balance.
3. **Targeted Engagement for Specific Age Groups**: Implement programs to engage and retain younger employees (25-34), who have high attrition rates, such as mentorship or flexible working arrangements.
4. **Address Education-Specific Retention Issues**: Conduct focus groups or surveys to understand challenges faced by employees with Life Sciences and Marketing backgrounds.
